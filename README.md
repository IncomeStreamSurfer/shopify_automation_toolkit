Now, to the script.

## How to use the toolkit

- This toolkit currently assumes that you have products in your Shopify store, but maybe they don't have tags.
- There are 3 scripts in this toolkit.

1. Shopify Tag Maker

A lot of stores have a lot of products, but they're not necessarily tagged properly. By giving Claude a list of our tags, we can get it to spit out new tags for your products. This means that if we make one list of all our product categories at the start, and then build the store logically, we can make sure we are maximising traffic. It is essential to tag your products, so you can use this tool to tag them easily and effectively.

2. Shopify Collection Maker

We still have a list of all of our tabs, now we want to make collections from it. Fill tags.csv with your product categories and then run Shopifycollectionmaker.py, this will start to create collections for you and upload them automatically to Shopify, it will also include the tag from the tags.csv

3. Shopfify Collection Grabber

In order to tie this all together and write articles that help grow the entire website, we also need to use the Shopify Collection Grabber. This allows us to easily grab a complete list of collection IDs and Collection Handles, which we can then use to write articles with products already embedded (using Hura Collection Embedder) and also with internal links (using the handles from the collection grabber)
